Peer review:

Ankit Kumar’s approach :-

-> DFS(Depth first search) based approach to find all the ‘O’s reachable from the boundary ‘O’s.
-> Marks all the reachable ‘O’s visited in a visited matrix.
-> Reachable ‘O’s are those which can be visited by following a path from a boundary ‘O’ formed through moving in 4 directions from the boundary ‘O’ and its connecting ‘O’s.
-> Converts the ‘O’s that are not marked as visited to ‘X’.
-> This will result in conversion of all the ‘O’s to ‘X’s which are inside a ‘surrounding region’.
